# Moving-Target-DStarLite

A real-time path planning algorithm for a car-like robot navigating through a dynamic environment in simulation for stationary and moving goals.

This is the initial version of D*-Lite algortihm implemented for a class project. 
Unfortunately, I lost the files including the created simulation environment with a four-way intersection where robots imitate pedestrians and cars following a pre-defined path.
